	<p>CodeRoom is a <b>responsive</b> website that collects some of the most popular web development technology. The website is based on CSS3, Jquery, AngularJS, AngularUI Boostrap, Twitter Boostrap, Animate.css and also several Jquery plugin. All the web frameworks and technologies are divided into four categories: CSS related, JavaScript library, MV* Frameworks and Development tools. UI design: The whole webpage is like a wall and all the technologies information are displayed like colorful sticky notes on it. User can check introduction and offical website of each technology on 'notes' and also view details like github link, cdn and install command by clicking the 'notes'. The details information are displayed in a modal.  </p>

	<a href="http://www.andyhch.com/bookmark.html"target="_blank"><h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span> AngularJS Bookmark Application </h2></a>
	<p> Developed a simple bookmark application based on AngularJS. The bookmarks are divided into four categories in default setting. User can add new category to the list, and also add,edit and delete existed bookmarks. This is only a front-end version application for demo so there is no data exchange between server-side and client-side and thus no operation will be saved when page got refresh. I'm still improving the code to add more functionality.</p>

	<p> Designed and created the layout of all game scenes and game items in a Flash game by Photoshop. The game is based on Chinese Zodiac and thus we need 12 different rooms to represent 12 animal signs. There were 14 scenes and hundred of game items in total and I edited every single item to provide better user interface. </p>
